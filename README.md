# Apigee API Hub Demo

The [apigee-apihub-demo](https://github.com/apigee-apihub-demo) organization is
a large-scale demonstration of the
[Apigee API Hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/what-is-api-hub)
and the [Apigee Registry API](https://github.com/apigee/registry).

The [apigee-apihub-demo](https://github.com/apigee-apihub-demo) organization
models things that a typical company or organization would use to load their
API information into an API registry and generate interesting artifacts that
could include linting results, quality scores, API clients, and configurations
for API runtime management systems like [Apigee X]().

Tasks are organized into narrowly-focused repositories to encourage their use
as samples.
