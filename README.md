# Apigee API Hub Demo

This organization is a large-scale demonstration of the
[Apigee API Hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-hub/what-is-api-hub)
and the [Apigee Registry API](https://github.com/apigee/registry).

This organization models things that a typical company or organization would
use to load their API information into an API registry and generate interesting
artifacts that could include linting results, quality scores, API clients, and
configurations for API runtime management systems like
[Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/apigee-x-google-clouds-more-powerful-api-management-platform).

Tasks are organized into narrowly-focused repositories to encourage their use
as samples.

This demonstration is not an officially supported Google product.
